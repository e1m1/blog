So during the downtime during the COVID-19 self-quarantine, I'll be developing a rudimentary textbased RPG in Java. I've decided to stick with the language that I have the most experience with to sort of hit the ground running. Maybe a golang port in the future...

Anyway.. I'm basing the rules and the first adventure off of [Generic Universal RolePlaying System (GURPS)](https://www.amazon.com/Jacksons-Generic-Universal-RolePlaying-System/dp/1556341598). The first one will be a story for thieves included within the original book - you'll ransack a house for some $$$ and there will be some traps (and enemies) along the way. Object is to try to make it out alive and richer along the way! I'm working on a way for people to be able to write their own story to plugin to the game, along with characters and items that they can make. For now, it's going to be nice and ugly and hardcoded :)

The first step was to implement an inventory system that can display items contained within an inventory. Next step is to create the character system...
